Project : Expense Tracker
"I'm a small business owner and struggle to keep tabs on my expenses. Is there a tool you can develop that
helps me manage my spending more effectively?"

Features Requested:
Expense Logging: "I need a way to easily input my expenses, categorize them, and see a history of my
spending."
Budget Setting: "Can the software allow me to set budgets for different expense categories and alert me if
I'm overspending?"
Visualization of Expenses: "It would be helpful to see graphs or charts that visually represent my spending
patterns."
Reminder System: "Can the tool remind me when certain bills are due or when I'm approaching my budget
limits?"
